For one thing, he\\nhated the summer holidays more than any other time of year. For another,\\nhe really wanted to do his homework but was forced to do it in secret,\\nin the dead of night. And he also happened to be a wizard.\\nIt was nearly midnight, and he was lying on his stomach in bed, the\\nblankets drawn right over his head like a tent, a flashlight in one hand\\nand a large leather-bound book (A History of Magic by Bathilda Bagshot)\\npropped open against the pillow. Harry moved the tip of his\\neagle-feather quill down the page, frowning as he looked for something\\nthat would help him write his essay, \"Witch Burning in the Fourteenth\\nCentury Was Completely Pointless discuss.\"\\nThe quill paused at the top of a likely-looking paragraph. Harry Pushed\\nhis round glasses up the bridge of his nose, moved his flashlight closer\\nto the book, and read:\\nNon-magic people (more commonly known as Muggles) were particularly\\nafraid of magic in medieval times, but not very good at recognizing it.\\nOn the rare occasion that they did catch a real witch or wizard, burning\\nhad no effect whatsoever. The witch or wizard would perform a basic\\nFlame Freezing Charm and then pretend to shriek with pain while enjoying\\na gentle, tickling sensation. Indeed, Wendelin the Weird enjoyed being\\nburned so much that she allowed herself to be caught no less than\\nfortyseven times in various disguises.\\nHarry put his quill between his teeth and reached underneath his pillow\\nfor his ink bottle and a roll of parchment. Slowly and very carefully he\\nunscrewed the ink bottle, dipped his quill into it, and began to write,\\npausing every now and then to listen, because if any of the Dursleys\\nheard the scratching of his quill on their way to the bathroom, he\\'d\\nprobably find himself locked in the cupboard under the stairs for the\\nrest of the summer.\\nThe Dursley family of number four, Privet Drive, was the reason that\\nHarry never enjoyed his summer holidays.

They were\\nMuggles, and they had a very medieval attitude toward magic. Harry\\'s\\ndead parents, who had been a witch and wizard themselves, were never\\nmentioned under the Dursleys\\' roof For years, Aunt Petunia and Uncle\\nVernon had hoped that if they kept Harry as downtrodden as possible,\\nthey would be able to squash the magic out of him. To their fury, they\\nhad been unsuccessful. These days they lived in terror of anyone finding\\nout that Harry had spent most of the last two years at Hogwarts School\\nof Witchcraft and Wizardry. The most they could do, however, was to lock\\naway Harry\\'s spellbooks, wand, cauldron, and broomstick at the start of\\nthe summer break, and forbid him to talk to the neighbors.\\nThis separation from his spellbooks had been a real problem for Harry,\\nbecause his teachers at Hogwarts had given him a lot of holiday work.\\nOne of the essays, a particularly nasty one about shrinking potions, was\\nfor Harry\\'s least favorite teacher, Professor Snape, who would be\\ndelighted to have an excuse to give Harry detention for a month. Harry\\nhad therefore seized his chance in the first week of the holidays. While\\nUncle Vernon, Aunt Petunia, and Dudley had gone out into the front\\ngarden to admire Uncle Vernon\\'s new company car (in very loud voices, so\\nthat the rest of the street would notice it too), Harry had crept\\ndownstairs, picked the lock on the cupboard under the stairs, grabbed\\nsome of his books, and hidden them in his bedroom. As long as he didn\\'t\\nleave spots of ink on the sheets, the Dursleys need never know that he\\nwas studying magic by night.\\nHarry was particularly keen to avoid trouble with his aunt and uncle at\\nthe moment, as they were already in an especially bad mood with him, all\\nbecause he\\'d received a telephone call from a fellow wizard one week\\ninto the school vacation.\\nRon Weasley, who was one of Harry\\'s best friends at Hogwarts, came from\\na whole family of wizards. This meant that he knew a lot of things Harry\\ndidn\\'t, but had never used a telephone before. Most unluckily, it had\\nbeen Uncle Vernon who had answered the call.\\n\"Vernon Dursley speaking.\"\\nHarry, who happened to be in the room at the time, froze as he heard\\nRon\\'s voice answer.'),\n",

There was just one very small improvement -- after swearing that he\\nwouldn't use her to send letters to any of his friends, Harry had been\\nallowed to let his owl, Hedwig, out at night. Uncle Vernon had given in\\nbecause of the racket Hedwig made if she was locked in her cage all the\\ntime.\\nHarry finished writing about Wendelin the Weird and paused to listen\\nagain. The silence in the dark house was broken only by the distant,\\ngrunting snores of his enormous cousin, Dudley. It must be very late,\\nHarry thought. His eyes were itching with tiredness. Perhaps he'd finish\\nthis essay tomorrow night....\\nHe replaced the top of the ink bottle; pulled an old pillowcase from\\nunder his bed; put the flashlight, A History of Magic, his essay, quill,\\nand ink inside it; got out of bed; and hid the lot under a loose\\nfloorboard under his bed. Then he stood up, stretched, and checked the\\ntime on the luminous alarm clock on his bedside table.\\nIt was one o'clock in the morning. Harry's stomach gave a funny jolt. He\\nhad been thirteen years old, without realizing it, for a whole hour.\\nYet another unusual thing about Harry was how little he looked forward\\nto his birthdays. He had never received a birthday card in his life. The\\nDursleys had completely ignored his last two birthdays, and he had no\\nreason to suppose they would remember this one.\\nHarry walked across the dark room, past Hedwig's large, empty cage, to\\nthe open window. He leaned on the sill, the cool night air pleasant on\\nhis face after a long time under the blankets. Hedwig had been absent\\nfor two nights now. Harry wasn't worried about her: she'd been gone this\\nlong before. But he hoped she'd be back soon -- she was the only living\\ncreature in this house who didn't flinch at the sight of him.\\nHarry, though still rather small and skinny for his age, had grown a few\\ninches over the last year.

The eyes\\nbehind his glasses were bright green, and on his forehead, clearly\\nvisible through his hair, was a thin scar, shaped like a bolt of\\nlightning.\\nOf all the unusual things about Harry, this scar was the most\\nextraordinary of all. It was not, as the Dursleys had pretended for ten\\nyears, a souvenir of the car crash that had killed Harry's parents,\\nbecause Lily and James Potter had not died in a car crash. They had been\\nmurdered, murdered by the most feared Dark wizard for a hundred years,\\nLord Voldemort. Harry had escaped from the same attack with nothing more\\nthan a scar on his forehead, where Voldemort's curse, instead of killing\\nhim, had rebounded upon its originator.

He stood quite still, watching it sink lower and lower. For a\\nsplit second he hesitated, his hand on the window latch, wondering\\nwhether to slam it shut. But then the bizarre creature soared over one\\nof the street lamps of Privet Drive, and Harry, realizing what it was,\\nleapt aside.\\nThrough the window soared three owls, two of them holding up the third,\\nwhich appeared to be unconscious.

I had contracted dragon pox\\nshortly before arriving at school, and while I was\\nno longer contagious, my pockmarked visage and\\ngreenish hue did not encourage many to approach\\nme. For his part, Albus had arrived at Hogwarts\\nunder the burden of unwanted notoriety. Scarcely a\\nyear previously, his father, Percival, had been con-\\nvicted of a savage and well-publicized attack upon\\nthree young Muggles.\\nAlbus never attempted to deny that his father\\n(who was to die in Azkaban) had committed this\\ncrime; on the contrary, when I plucked up courage\\nto ask him, he assured me that he knew his father\\nto be guilty. Beyond that, Dumbledore refused to\\nspeak of the sad business, though many attempted\\nto make him do so. Some, indeed, were disposed to\\npraise his father’s action and assumed that Albus\\ntoo was a Muggle-hater. They could not have been\\nmore mistaken.

By\\nthe end of his ﬁrst year he would never again be\\nknown as the son of a Muggle-hater, but as nothing\\nmore or less than the most brilliant student ever\\nseen at the school. Those of us who were privileged\\nto be his friends beneﬁted from his example, not to\\nmention his help and encouragement, with which he\\nwas always generous. He confessed to me in later life\\nthat he knew even then that his greatest pleasure\\nlay in teaching.\\nHe not only won every prize of note that the\\nschool oﬀered, he was soon in regular correspon-\\ndence with the most notable magical names of the\\nday, including Nicolas Flamel, the celebrated al-\\nchemist; Bathilda Bagshot, the noted historian; and\\nAdalbert Waﬄing, the magical theoretician.
